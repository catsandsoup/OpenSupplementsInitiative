# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves conducting a comprehensive full stack root cause analysis to systematically identify, diagnose, and document errors affecting the frontend UI, data flow between components, and backend data retrieval processes. The analysis will provide actionable insights to improve system reliability and user experience by identifying bottlenecks, error patterns, and failure points across the entire application stack.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze frontend UI errors and rendering issues, so that I can identify components that are failing or causing poor user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis tool is executed THEN the system SHALL scan all React components for error boundaries, console errors, and rendering failures
2. WHEN UI components are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify components with missing error handling or improper state management
3. WHEN component analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a report listing all UI components with potential issues and their severity levels
4. IF a component has unhandled errors THEN the system SHALL flag it as high priority for remediation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to trace data flow between frontend and backend systems, so that I can identify where data transformation or transmission errors occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data flow analysis is initiated THEN the system SHALL trace API calls from frontend components to backend endpoints
2. WHEN API requests are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify failed requests, timeout issues, and malformed data payloads
3. WHEN response data is examined THEN the system SHALL verify data structure consistency and identify transformation errors
4. IF data flow interruptions are detected THEN the system SHALL document the exact point of failure and affected user workflows

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze backend data retrieval processes, so that I can identify database query issues, performance bottlenecks, and data integrity problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend analysis is executed THEN the system SHALL examine all database queries for performance issues and errors
2. WHEN API endpoints are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify endpoints with high error rates or slow response times
3. WHEN data validation is checked THEN the system SHALL verify that input validation and error handling are properly implemented
4. IF database connection issues are found THEN the system SHALL document connection pool problems and query optimization opportunities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate a comprehensive error analysis report, so that I can prioritize fixes based on impact and frequency of issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a structured report with categorized findings
2. WHEN errors are documented THEN the system SHALL include error frequency, impact assessment, and recommended remediation steps
3. WHEN the report is generated THEN the system SHALL prioritize issues by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
4. IF multiple related errors are found THEN the system SHALL group them by root cause and suggest comprehensive fixes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate system health across all components, so that I can ensure the analysis covers all critical system functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system health check is performed THEN the system SHALL verify connectivity between all major components
2. WHEN health validation runs THEN the system SHALL test database connections, API endpoints, and frontend routing
3. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL report on system availability and identify any unreachable components
4. IF critical system components are unavailable THEN the system SHALL flag these as immediate priority issues requiring attention
