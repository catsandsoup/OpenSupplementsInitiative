# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The OSI (Open Supplements Initiative) aims to revolutionize dietary supplement information management by establishing a comprehensive, interoperable data format that replaces fragmented PDFs and proprietary databases. This platform will provide healthcare practitioners, software developers, and regulatory bodies with a standardized JSON-based format for supplement data that ensures consistency, interoperability, and global accessibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a supplement manufacturer, I want to submit comprehensive product data with full traceability and evidence, so that I can obtain OSI certification that proves my product's authenticity and quality to regulators and consumers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting product data THEN the system SHALL require complete ingredient sourcing information including supplier names, factory locations, and batch tracking
2. WHEN uploading evidence THEN the system SHALL accept third-party lab test results, factory certifications, and scientific literature with DOI links
3. WHEN providing health claims THEN the system SHALL require specific scientific studies that support each claim with evidence quality grading
4. IF ingredient sources change THEN the system SHALL require re-submission and re-certification of the product
5. WHEN data is submitted THEN the system SHALL generate a unique submission ID and track the certification status through all review stages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a software developer, I want to integrate supplement data into my healthcare application, so that my users can access trusted, up-to-date supplement information without building their own data collection system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with the OSI platform THEN the system SHALL provide a standardized JSON API for supplement data access
2. WHEN requesting supplement data THEN the system SHALL return machine-readable JSON following the OSI format specification
3. WHEN consuming supplement data THEN the system SHALL support filtering by regulatory identifiers (TGA ARTG numbers)
4. IF supplement data is updated THEN the system SHALL provide versioning information to track changes
5. WHEN accessing the API THEN the system SHALL support bulk data retrieval for multiple supplements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a regulatory body or certifying organization, I want to publish supplement information in a standardized format, so that healthcare software can directly consume and utilize our trusted data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN publishing supplement data THEN the system SHALL accept data in the OSI JSON format
2. WHEN data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate against the OSI schema specification
3. WHEN regulatory information changes THEN the system SHALL support updates to existing supplement records
4. IF data contains regulatory identifiers THEN the system SHALL link to official authority sources
5. WHEN data is published THEN the system SHALL provide digital signatures for data integrity verification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a nutritionist or dietitian, I want to compare supplement products accurately, so that I can make evidence-based recommendations to my clients without confusion from inconsistent product descriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing supplements THEN the system SHALL normalize ingredient names and quantities for accurate comparison
2. WHEN viewing product information THEN the system SHALL display permitted indications with evidence notes
3. WHEN accessing safety information THEN the system SHALL present all warnings and advisories clearly
4. IF allergen information exists THEN the system SHALL display detailed allergen data and "free-from" claims
5. WHEN reviewing products THEN the system SHALL show indication requirements and mandatory statements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data administrator, I want to maintain the quality and integrity of supplement data, so that users can trust the information provided through the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is entered THEN the system SHALL capture complete metadata including source, date, and version information
2. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL enforce the OSI schema requirements for all fields
3. WHEN data conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to resolve inconsistencies
4. IF data sources are updated THEN the system SHALL track provenance and update history
5. WHEN publishing data THEN the system SHALL ensure all required fields are populated according to the OSI specification

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an OSI reviewer, I want to systematically verify all submitted evidence and data, so that I can ensure only products with complete and accurate information receive certification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing submissions THEN the system SHALL provide a structured checklist of all required evidence types
2. WHEN validating lab tests THEN the system SHALL verify test results against accredited laboratory standards and certifications
3. WHEN checking ingredient sources THEN the system SHALL cross-reference supplier certifications with factory inspection records
4. IF evidence is insufficient THEN the system SHALL provide specific feedback on what additional documentation is required
5. WHEN approving products THEN the system SHALL require multi-level approval with digital signatures from authorized reviewers

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a consumer, I want to verify the authenticity and safety of supplement products, so that I can make informed purchasing decisions based on transparent, verified information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning a product QR code THEN the system SHALL display complete ingredient sourcing and manufacturing information
2. WHEN viewing product details THEN the system SHALL show all scientific studies supporting health claims with direct DOI links
3. WHEN checking certificate status THEN the system SHALL provide real-time verification of certificate validity and expiration
4. IF safety issues arise THEN the system SHALL display any recalls, warnings, or certificate revocations immediately
5. WHEN comparing products THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side comparison of ingredients, sources, and evidence quality

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a business purchasing supplements for resale, I want to verify supplier certificates and product authenticity, so that I can ensure I'm selling legitimate, certified products to my customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verifying supplier products THEN the system SHALL provide batch-level certificate verification
2. WHEN checking product authenticity THEN the system SHALL validate certificates against tamper-proof digital signatures
3. WHEN monitoring inventory THEN the system SHALL alert if any products have certificate status changes or recalls
4. IF certificates expire THEN the system SHALL provide advance notification and renewal status tracking
5. WHEN conducting due diligence THEN the system SHALL provide complete audit trail of product certification history

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a regulatory authority (TGA), I want to access verified supplement data with OSI certification, so that I can streamline my approval process and leverage third-party verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing TGA applications THEN the system SHALL provide standardized data export in regulatory-required formats
2. WHEN validating manufacturer claims THEN the system SHALL provide access to all supporting evidence and documentation
3. WHEN checking compliance THEN the system SHALL show real-time certificate status and any compliance issues
4. IF products are recalled THEN the system SHALL provide immediate notification and certificate revocation status
5. WHEN conducting audits THEN the system SHALL provide complete traceability from raw materials to final product

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to maintain the security and integrity of the certification system, so that certificates cannot be forged and the system remains trustworthy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating certificates THEN the system SHALL use cryptographic signatures that cannot be forged or tampered with
2. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption
3. WHEN detecting fraud THEN the system SHALL implement automated monitoring for suspicious activities and duplicate submissions
4. IF security breaches occur THEN the system SHALL provide immediate incident response and certificate revocation capabilities
5. WHEN backing up data THEN the system SHALL maintain secure, immutable backups with point-in-time recovery capabilities
