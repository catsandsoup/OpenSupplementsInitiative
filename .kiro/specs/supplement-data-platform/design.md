# Design Document

## Overview

The OSI (Open Supplements Initiative) platform is designed as a comprehensive certification system that creates a chain of trust from raw ingredient sourcing to consumer verification. The platform addresses the critical gap in supplement transparency by requiring manufacturers to provide complete traceability and evidence before receiving cryptographically signed certificates.

**Core Workflow:**
1. **Manufacturer Data Submission** - Complete product data with ingredient sourcing, factory details, lab tests, and scientific literature
2. **Evidence Verification** - OSI staff systematically verify all submitted evidence against accredited standards
3. **Multi-Level Approval** - Structured approval process with digital signatures from authorized reviewers
4. **Certificate Generation** - Cryptographically signed certificates with unique identifiers and QR codes
5. **Public Verification** - Real-time certificate validation accessible to consumers, businesses, and regulators
6. **Ongoing Monitoring** - Continuous monitoring for changes, recalls, and certificate status updates

**Trust Architecture:**
- **Immutable Evidence Chain** - All evidence is cryptographically hashed and linked to prevent tampering
- **Multi-Signature Approval** - Certificates require multiple authorized signatures to prevent single-point fraud
- **Real-Time Validation** - Certificate status can be verified instantly via API or QR code scanning
- **Audit Trail** - Complete history of all changes, approvals, and certificate operations

## Critical System Details

### Digital Signing Process

**Certificate Authority Structure:**
```
OSI Root CA (Offline, Air-gapped)
├── OSI Intermediate CA (Online, HSM-protected)
    ├── Product Certificate Signing Key
    ├── Organization Certificate Signing Key
    └── Reviewer Signing Keys (Individual)
```

**Multi-Signature Approval Process:**
1. **Primary Reviewer** - Technical review and initial approval signature
2. **Secondary Reviewer** - Independent verification and second signature
3. **Authorized Signatory** - Final approval with certificate issuance authority
4. **System Signature** - Automated cryptographic seal with timestamp

**Certificate Generation Process:**
```
1. Collect all approved data and evidence hashes
2. Generate certificate serial number (UUID + timestamp)
3. Create X.509 certificate with OSI custom extensions:
   - Product ID and batch information
   - Evidence hash chain
   - Approval signatures
   - Expiration date (2 years default)
4. Sign certificate with OSI Intermediate CA private key
5. Record certificate hash on blockchain
6. Generate QR code with verification URL
7. Create printable certificate PDF
```

**Signature Verification:**
- **Certificate Chain Validation** - Verify against OSI Root CA
- **Revocation Check** - Check Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
- **Timestamp Validation** - Verify certificate is within validity period
- **Evidence Integrity** - Verify all evidence hashes match original submissions
- **Blockchain Verification** - Confirm certificate hash exists on blockchain

## Error Handling

### Error Response Format

All API errors follow a consistent format:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "details": {
      "field": "specific field with error",
      "value": "invalid value",
      "constraint": "validation rule violated"
    },
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "requestId": "uuid"
  }
}
```

### Error Categories

1. **Validation Errors (400)**
   - Schema validation failures
   - Business rule violations
   - Required field missing
   - Invalid data formats

2. **Authentication Errors (401)**
   - Invalid API key
   - Expired tokens
   - Insufficient permissions

3. **Not Found Errors (404)**
   - Supplement not found
   - Invalid endpoint

4. **Conflict Errors (409)**
   - Duplicate ARTG numbers
   - Version conflicts
   - Concurrent modification

5. **Server Errors (500)**
   - Database connection issues
   - External service failures
   - Unexpected system errors

### Error Recovery Strategies

- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Circuit breaker pattern for external service calls
- Graceful degradation when non-critical services are unavailable
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Coverage Target**: 90% code coverage
- **Framework**: Jest for Node.js services
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Business logic validation
  - Data transformation functions
  - API endpoint handlers
  - Utility functions

### Integration Testing
- **Database Integration**: Test with real PostgreSQL instance
- **API Integration**: End-to-end API testing with real HTTP calls
- **External Service Integration**: Mock external APIs with realistic responses
- **Schema Validation**: Test OSI schema compliance

### Performance Testing
- **Load Testing**: Simulate concurrent users and API calls
- **Stress Testing**: Test system limits and failure points
- **Database Performance**: Query optimization and index effectiveness
- **Search Performance**: Elasticsearch query performance under load

### Security Testing
- **Authentication Testing**: Verify JWT token handling and expiration
- **Authorization Testing**: Ensure proper role-based access control
- **Input Validation**: Test for SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and abuse prevention

### Data Quality Testing
- **Schema Compliance**: Automated validation against OSI schema
- **Data Integrity**: Cross-field validation and consistency checks
- **Import/Export Testing**: Bulk data operation validation
- **Migration Testing**: Data migration and transformation accuracy

### Test Data Management
- **Synthetic Data**: Generate realistic test supplement data
- **Anonymized Production Data**: Use sanitized real data for testing
- **Test Fixtures**: Maintain consistent test datasets
- **Data Cleanup**: Automated test data cleanup procedures

### Continuous Testing
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing in deployment pipeline
- **Regression Testing**: Automated testing of existing functionality
- **Monitoring Tests**: Production health checks and synthetic monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance baseline tracking
